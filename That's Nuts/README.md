That's Nuts!

I don't love the settings gear as an icon. It is a universal standard at this point, so should be used when possible. Were it not the standard, however, I can think of some nicer alternatives. 

One of which is the nut. It scales better and is less visually intrusive. This is not an issue that I feel strongly about, so I'm going to stop talking about it now.

In the demo, I've got a pure CSS nut that unscrews itself and drops the curtain on a hover event. This could be used to reveal the settings for a page. The element that I chose for the hover event would not make sense for most applications, but it conveyed the idea well and allowed me to avoid any JS.
